<h2>Ingredients</h2>
<ul>
<li>1 1/2 cups cold whole milk</li>
<li>1 (5.1-ounce) package vanilla instant pudding and pie filling (such as Jell-O)</li>
<li>1 teaspoon vanilla extract</li>
<li>2 1/2 cups plus 2 tablespoons heavy whipping cream, divided</li>
<li>1/4 cup confectioners’ sugar</li>
<li>1 (14-ounce) can sweetened condensed milk</li>
<li>1 (8-ounce) container sour cream</li>
<li>1/4 cup salted caramel sauce, plus more microwaved sauce for drizzling</li>
<li>1 (1 lb 7,7 oz box) buttery crackers (such as Ritz®) (about 98 crackers)</li>
<li>6 cups thinly sliced spotted bananas (about 3 1/2 pounds bananas)</li>
<li>Flakey sea salt</li>
</ul>
<h2>Steps</h2>
<ol>
    <li>Gather all ingredients.</li>
    <li>Whisk together milk and pudding and pie filling in a large bowl until mostly smooth. Let stand until very thick, about 5 minutes.</li>
    <li>Meanwhile, beat vanilla and 2 1/2 cups of the heavy whipping cream in a large bowl with an electric mixer on high speed until soft peaks form, about 2 minutes. Gradually add confectioners' sugar, and beat until stiff peaks form, 15 to 30 seconds.</li>
    <li>Whisk sweetened condensed milk and sour cream into thickened pudding until smooth. Fold in whipped cream until smooth and light.</li>
    <li>Microwave 1/4 cup salted caramel and remaining 2 tablespoons heavy whipping cream in a small microwave-safe bowl on high until loosened, about 10 seconds; whisk to combine.</li>
    <li>Place 32 of the crackers in an even layer in the bottom of a 9x13-inch baking dish, breaking up crackers as needed to fill space. Spread 3 cups of the pudding mixture in an even layer over crackers. Top pudding mixture with 2 cups of the sliced bananas. Drizzle evenly with about 2 tablespoons of the salted caramel mixture. Repeat layering process once more, ending with a layer of salted caramel. Evenly top with remaining 34 crackers, breaking them as needed to fit. Spread remaining 3 cups pudding mixture over crackers.</li>
    <li>Store, covered, in the refrigerator for at least 8 hours or up to overnight. Before serving, top with remaining 2 cups sliced bananas.</li>
    <li>Drizzle with salted caramel sauce and sprinkle flaky sea salt.</li>
