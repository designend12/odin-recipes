<h2>Description</h2>
<p>This dulce de leche ice cream, with ripples of lightened dulce de leche in every scoop, is very creamy and rich, with just the perfect hint of salt.</p>
<h2>Ingredients</h2>
<ul>
    <li>1 (13.4 ounce) can dulce de leche</li>
    <li>2 cups heavy whipping cream, divided</li>
    <li>2 teaspoons vanilla extract</li>
    <li>1/2 teaspoon kosher salt</li>
    <li>flaky sea salt</li>
</ul>
<h2>Steps</h2>
<ol>
    <li>Gather all ingredients. Line inside of a 5x9-inch loaf pan with plastic wrap, leaving a 1-inch overhang on both long sides; set aside.</li>
    <li>Whisk dulce de leche and 1/3 cup of the heavy cream in a small mixing bowl until evenly combined, about 1 minute. Transfer 1 cup of the dulce de leche mixture to a large mixing bowl, and set aside. Reserve remaining mixture for drizzling.</li>
    <li>Beat vanilla, salt, and remaining 1 2/3 cups heavy cream with a stand mixer fitted with a whisk attachment on medium-high speed just until stiff peaks form, about 3 minutes. Fold whipped cream, in 3 additions, into the 1 cup of dulce de leche mixture in large bowl until fully incorporated and no streaks remain.</li>
    <li>Transfer half of the whipped cream mixture into prepared loaf pan, spreading into an even layer. Spoon about half of the reserved dulce de leche mixture evenly over whipped cream layer. Repeat process with the remaining whipped cream mixture and remaining reserved dulce de leche mixture.</li>
    <li>Using a butter knife gently swirl dulce de leche mixture and whipped cream mixture together to create a decorative design.</li>
    <li>Cover loosely with plastic wrap and store in freezer until fully set, at least 8 hours or up to 12 hours. Sprinkle with flaky sea salt, and serve.</li>
